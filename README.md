### Abstract

Traffic congestion is currently one of the most important problems in cities, and several approaches have been proposed to reduce it. In this paper we propose a novel formu-lation of the Traffic Light Scheduling Problem (TLSP) in order to alleviate it. In addition to consider the duration of the phases---colour states---of the different traffic lights involved, the time offset for each intersection, which allows the synchronisation among traffic lights of adjacent joints to be established, and is a key parameter for traffic management, is also taken into account. This novel variant of the problem allows more realistic scenarios to be modelled, and as a result, the TLSP becomes much harder to solve in comparison to previous formulations. The proposal of more advanced and efficient techniques than those applied in past research is thus required.  In order to deal with this novel formulation of the TLSP, we propose the application of diversity-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, which have shown to provide promising results when optimising single-objective problems. The wide experimental evaluation performed over a set of real-world instances demonstrates the good performance of the diversity-based multi-objective method in comparison to the best-performing single-objective optimisers previously proposed to tackle this problem, among other approaches. Consequently, in this work, we provide new state-of-the-art algorithmic schemes to deal with the TLSP.
